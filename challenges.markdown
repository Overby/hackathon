## Unemployment

* There's evidence that availability of summer jobs have a direct influence on
reducing crime. What about a specialized job board where local businesses could
post one or more jobs, then students could browse and even apply for them?
* There are dozens of huge job sites out there, but it's hard to keep track of
your search across them. What about a single site where you could use something
like a bookmarklet to create an aggregate listing of all the ads you're interested
in?
* For some kinds of jobs there are dozens or hundreds of listings to sift through.
What about an app that could pull listings matching a certain search criteria, then
use bayesian filtering to build up a profile of what I'm looking for and highlight
the jobs most likely to be interesting to me.
*For many workers, particularly those who don't speak English well, 
not being paid or not being paid in full by employers is a persistent problem. Think
about an application or tool that workers could use to somehow track their hours
on the job, store a timestamped photo of paychecks received, or otherwise consider
how workers could use a third-party record of payment information so they can more
easily collect their wages.



## Housing / Homelessness

* Homeless shelters fill up. It would be great if a person with only access to
SMS were able to find out which shelters currently have a bed available.
* Denver is experiencing record low availability for property rental or purchase
and competition is fierce. It would be great if there were a site where you could
signup, specify what you're looking for, and get a text or email when a new matching
listing shows up on Craigslist.
* Housing is more accessible with roommates, but it's hard to find roommates unless
a group has an existing place and an open room. How about a way to find roommates
who share similar requirements but don't yet have a place. You could create a
profile with what your requirements are, then get matched up with other users
who fit.
*Homeless individuals need many of the same documents others need: health, legal, 
financial, educational, personal ID documents, and other types of records. 
Think about ways the homeless population could have a digital storage place for information 
that they can use to apply for jobs, access needed services from organizations or government 
agencies with, or use to receive proper medical care even when they're moving around very
often. Think of it like a digital backpack for all the information or things a person needs 
on a regular basis.


## Accessibility to Services
*Legal aid organizations and volunteers need help managing the influx of those who need their
help. Their time needs to be maximized. Design a human-centered system that an organization
could simply access for easily scheduling an appointment with specific members of 
legal aid staff that would also send an email or text message remind to both parties beforehand. 
Think about how this could be used throughout the entire legal process--used first for 
scheduling and coordinating meetings, but later also perhaps for keeping track 
of court dates, when documents are due to the court or to legal aid staff, and 
generally helping both clients and volunteers with often stressful legal matters.
