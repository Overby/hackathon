## Housing / Homelessness

* Homeless shelters fill up. It would be great if a person with only access to
SMS were able to find out which shelters currently have a bed available.
* Denver is experiencing record low availability for property rental or purchase
and competition is fierce. It would be great if there were a site where you could
signup, specify what you're looking for, and get a text or email when a new matching
listing shows up on Craigslist.
* Housing is more accessible with roommates, but it's hard to find roommates unless
a group has an existing place and an open room. How about a way to find roommates
who share similar requirements but don't yet have a place. You could create a
profile with what your requirements are, then get matched up with other users
who fit.
