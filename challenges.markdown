## Unemployment

* There's evidence that availability of summer jobs have a direct influence on
reducing crime. What about a specialized job board where local businesses could
post one or more jobs, then students could browse and even apply for them?
* There are dozens of huge job sites out there, but it's hard to keep track of
your search across them. What about a single site where you could use something
like a bookmarklet to create an aggregate listing of all the ads you're interested
in?
* For some kinds of jobs there are dozens or hundreds of listings to sift through.
What about an app that could pull listings matching a certain search criteria, then
use bayesian filtering to build up a profile of what I'm looking for and highlight
the jobs most likely to be interesting to me.

## Housing / Homelessness

* Homeless shelters fill up. It would be great if a person with only access to
SMS were able to find out which shelters currently have a bed available.
* Denver is experiencing record low availability for property rental or purchase
and competition is fierce. It would be great if there were a site where you could
signup, specify what you're looking for, and get a text or email when a new matching
listing shows up on Craigslist.
* Housing is more accessible with roommates, but it's hard to find roommates unless
a group has an existing place and an open room. How about a way to find roommates
who share similar requirements but don't yet have a place. You could create a
profile with what your requirements are, then get matched up with other users
who fit.
